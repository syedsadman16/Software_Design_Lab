# Database Project
This project was developed using the MySQL database with myPhpAdmin interface and  MAMP to host the server. In this assignment, I created a dashboard that displays a table and pie chart displaying the grades of students enrolled in a class during the Spring 2020 semester. The program is designed with CRUD operations and lets the admin update, delete and add students.
